music-utils
===========

These are some tools I use to organize / play with my audio file library.
At the moment, I've only uploaded one, but once I get around to looking through the backups of the drive I was using when
I wrote them, I'll post the others.

They're all relatively simple bash scripts which perform simple functions (e.g.
implementing a shuffle feature in a directory structure full of music, simplifying the process of renaming files generated
by the audio CD ripper that came with FeeBSD (yes, I used FreeBSD when I wrote most of these. That was an awesome year
and I regret nothing).
